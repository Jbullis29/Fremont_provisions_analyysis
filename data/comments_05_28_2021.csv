"  Brandon did a wonderful job, very attentive and kind. He had mentioned the kitchen forgetting the chipotle sauce when he had ordered it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
      I think the servers should have a united front with the kitchen.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"  Shane was very attentive to the overal restaurant, checking in and making rounds with every table.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The entire experience was amazing.  I loved it and will be returning.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The food was top notch.  The only thing I would suggest with the kids menu is to make sure everthing comes out fully cooked and the portions were a bit large for a child.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  Wrapping steak knife with the cutlery so servers don't have to keep running back and forth and are availble to tend to other needs of customers.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
  The restaurant is very unique and is now my favorite here in Canon.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
